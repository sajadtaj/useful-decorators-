# Decorators?

Developers can modify a function's behavior using decorators, without changing its source code. This provides a concise and flexible way to enhance and extend the functionality of functions.

In Python, a decorator is a function that allows you to modify the behavior of another function without changing its core logic. It takes another function as an argument and returns the function with extended functionality. This way, you can use decorators to add some extra logic to existing functions to increase reusability with just a few lines of code. In this article, we will explore eight built-in Python decorators that can help you write more elegant and maintainable code.
